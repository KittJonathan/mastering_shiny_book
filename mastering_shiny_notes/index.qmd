# Getting started

## Your first Shiny app

### Introduction

Every Shiny app had two components:

-   the user interface (UI) which defines how the app looks

-   the server function which defines how the app works

To install Shiny:

```{r}
#| eval: false
install.packages("shiny")

```

Load the package in the current R session:

```{r}
library(shiny)
```

### Create app directory and file

The simplest way to create a Shiny app is to create a new directory for the app, and put a single file called `app.R` in it. This file will be used to tell Shiny both how the app should look and how it should behave.
